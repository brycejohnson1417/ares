# 30m heartbeat checklist (keep terse; batch checks)

- OpenClaw health quick check (status/events). Alert Bryce only on issues.
- GitHub repo: `git fetch` + detect upstream drift; report if origin/main differs.
- ClawHub scan: 1 query for high-leverage new/updated skills (monitoring/automation). Log candidates.
- Cost guardrail: keep Brave web_search minimal (<=3 results unless Bryce asks).
